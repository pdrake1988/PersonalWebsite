      <p>Hello, my name is Paul Drake and I specialize in web development. I am a graduate of Lubbock Coding Academy with Certification in Full Stack Software Development as of November, 2020. Please visit my portfolio at www.github.com/pdrake1988 to view my Capstone Project and Movie Showtime App Project that I completed at Lubbock Coding Academy along with other web development projects in progress. I have an innate curiosity for pattern-finding, logic, problem-solving and trying to find innovative solutions. In my spare time, I love to solve puzzles. When I realized that the process of coding and programming was like solving a puzzle, I became absolutely hooked on web development. Learning new languages and creating complex projects is rewarding for me.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        One thing that sets me apart is I am a former Paramedic graduate with an Emergency Medical Services Technician Certification graduating in the top 5% of my class. I initially wanted to provide out-of-hospital acute care and help others and worked required clinical hours towards this goal. After some time, I realized this career was not a fit because the tasks became stagnant. I am thrilled to have made this change to web development where I can support the tech and ecommerce industries.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>When I have the day off, I enjoy cooking delicious meals in the kitchen, listening to music, playing video games and online card games. I also love spending quality time with my family.</p>
